# Basic dummy stub for the arcade game

Demo version.
Control Dangerous Dave in wacky space riding green glowing blob by means of arrow keys.
More stuff to come (why we have only 24h per day?).

## Todo plans

- make Dave draggable by mouse
- make Dave leave moving trace
- implement space bar fire
- add sounds to start, shot and backdrop ambience
- improve performance if it is possible

## Done

- make Dave to turn arround to the direction he is heading to
- random location of glowing stars

## Technical details

Ultra low-budget i3-3220 from 2013 runs it quite decently.

Turn off some planet orbits [or turn them off completely] in markup to improve performance by a big margin.
