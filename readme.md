# Basic dummy stub for the arcade game

Demo version. Incomplete functionality.
<br>
Intended to be used on desktop & laptop. Limited mobile use.
<br>
Control Dangerous Dave in wacky space riding green glowing blob by means of:

- [▲] [▼] [◄] [►] arrow keys for movement
- [Spacebar] for laser shot
- [F8] to turn on/off orbiting planets
- [Enter] to become as cool as Duke Nukem

Features:

- no heavy frameworks and dependencies, just pure JavaScript
- compact size, less than 500Kb including graphics and audio
- tiny core only 35Kb!
- completely free, no license, do with it whatever you what

<br>
<br>
More stuff to come (why we have only 24h per day?).

## GFX niceties

- multitude of space backdrops
- static stars [layer1], moving and rotating with transparency [layer2]
- random blinking [layer3] and moving stars [layer4]
- "raining" moving stars from top to bottom [layer5]

## Todo plans

- improve performance if it is possible

## Done stuff

- beta mobile [touch] support
- add sounds to startup, actions and backdrop ambience
- make Dave leave trace while moving
- implement space bar fire
- make Dave to turn around to the direction he is heading to
- random starting location of blinking stars, they also should change their formation upon blinking

## Technical details

Ultra low-budget i3-3220 from 2013 runs it quite decently, but i already see the limit of the configuration.
<br>
Turn off some orbiting planets to improve performance by a big margin.
