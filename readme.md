# Basic dummy stub for the arcade game

Demo version. No mobile layout at this time.
<br>
Intended to be used on desktop & laptop.
<br>
Control Dangerous Dave in wacky space riding green glowing blob by means of arrow keys.
<br>
<br>
More stuff to come (why we have only 24h per day?).

## GFX niceties

- double backdrop, second one is moving and rotating with transparency
- random blinking and moving stars upon startup
- "raining" moving stars from top to bottom

## Todo plans

- scale Dave when he is going up/down to show perspective
- make Dave draggable by mouse
- improve performance if it is possible
- implement mobile version

## Done stuff

- add sounds to startup, actions and backdrop ambience
- make Dave leave trace while moving
- implement space bar fire
- make Dave to turn arround to the direction he is heading to
- random starting location of blinking stars, they also should change their formation upon blinking

## Technical details

Ultra low-budget i3-3220 from 2013 runs it quite decently, but i already see the limit of the configuration.
<br>
Turn off some planet orbits [or turn them off completely] in markup to improve performance by a big margin.
